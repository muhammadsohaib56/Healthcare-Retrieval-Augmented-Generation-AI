The discomfort increased by mid-day to a substernal 'ache' without radiation or associated shortness of breath/diaphoresis. He was sitting in a chair waiting for his wife to get ready, they were going to a block party. The pain then continued with intermittent worsening for 'hours,' no exacerbation with movement. He finally lay down to sleep that night and when he awoke in the morning the pain had dissipated completely. The pressure and pain returned yesterday while patient was sitting and doing work on his Ipad. He then got up and walked on a treadmill - to his surprise, the pain soon subsided. He has not taken any SL nitro at home. Given his recurrent symptoms, patient called his cardiologist who referred him to the ED.
