# 🏥 Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI

## 📋 Overview

**Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI** is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system tailored for **healthcare applications**. Leveraging the **MIMIC-IV-Ext** dataset, it retrieves clinical notes and generates comprehensive responses to medical queries.

Built using:
- **SentenceTransformers** for embeddings  
- **FAISS** for efficient document retrieval  
- **DistilGPT-2** for natural language generation

A **modern Gradio web interface** enables healthcare professionals, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to explore clinical insights interactively.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🔎 **Clinical Query Processing**  
  Input medical questions and receive detailed, structured answers.

- 📂 **Document Retrieval**  
  Retrieves relevant clinical notes from the MIMIC-IV-Ext dataset using SentenceTransformers and FAISS.

- 🧠 **Answer Generation**  
  Uses DistilGPT-2 to produce natural language answers with markdown formatting.

- 💻 **User Interface**  
  Clean, light-themed **Gradio** web interface for smooth interaction.

- ⚙️ **Scalable Architecture**  
  Designed to handle large clinical datasets efficiently.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- [**Python 3.8+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Code Editor** (e.g., VS Code)
- Access to **MIMIC-IV-Ext** dataset via [**PhysioNet**](https://physionet.org/)

---

## ⬇️ Download and Setup

### 📥 1. Clone or Download the Repository

#### Option 1: Clone (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadsohaib56/Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI.git
cd Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI
```

#### Option 2: Download ZIP
- Go to the GitHub repo  
- Click **Code > Download ZIP**  
- Extract it and open a terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI
```

---

### 🧱 2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### `requirements.txt` includes:
```
gradio
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
transformers
torch
numpy
```

---

### 📂 3. Obtain the MIMIC-IV-Ext Dataset

> ⚠️ **Note:** Dataset not included due to licensing.

- Request access from [**PhysioNet**](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/)  
- After approval, download and extract to:
```
/mimic-iv-ext-direct-1.0.0/
```
- Place it inside your project root

---

### 🧹 4. Preprocess the Dataset

Run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

This will extract clinical notes and save them as `documents.json`.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### ▶️ 1. Launch the Application

Start the Gradio interface:
```bash
python app.py
```

A local web server will start at:  
📍 `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

---

### 🌐 2. Use the Web Interface

- Open the browser at the above URL  
- Type your clinical query (e.g.,  
  _"What treatment was given for hypertension?"_)  
- Click **"Get Answer"**

---

### 📑 3. Review Results

- ✅ **Retrieved Documents**: Shows relevant clinical notes  
- 💬 **Generated Answer**: Markdown-formatted summary using DistilGPT-2  
  Example output:
  ```markdown
  ### Treatment Summary
  The patient was given Lisinopril to manage hypertension...
  ```

## 📊 Dataset: MIMIC-IV-Ext

- A large-scale dataset with **de-identified ICU notes**  
- Must be obtained via [**PhysioNet Access Request**](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/)

After download, place it here:
```
Healthcare-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-AI/
└── mimic-iv-ext-direct-1.0.0/
```

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Dependency Issues
Make sure you are using:
```bash
python --version   # Should be 3.8+
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### ❌ Dataset Not Found
Ensure the directory `mimic-iv-ext-direct-1.0.0/` exists in the project root and contains valid data files.

### ❌ Gradio URL Not Loading
- Check if port 7860 is in use  
- To change the port in `app.py`, update the launch command:
```python
demo.launch(port=8000)
```
